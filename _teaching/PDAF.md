I have worked on this project since my junior year. PDAF is a technique that estimates the in-focus position according to the in-put pair of phase images. Most previous PDAF methods are noise sensitive, so noisyphase information usually lead to slow or inaccurate autofocus.  To address this is-sue, I designed a model, called AF-Net, based on convolutional neural network (CNN).The AF-Net accurately estimates the correspondence between phase images and es-timates the in-focus position accordingly. In most cases, the AF-Net reaches the in-focus position in two lens movements regardless of the noise. Our work on PDAF has been published in **IEEE Transactions on Image Processing** and **Electrical Imaging** (see publication). Our demo videos of this work are available in the following links: <br/>
