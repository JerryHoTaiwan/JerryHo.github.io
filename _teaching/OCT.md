I have worked on this project since July 2019. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invading method to obtain image from human skin. Our target is to develop a deep learning algorithm that accurately detects Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) so that we can complete the whole detection process in a short time. This project is on-going and I have improved the accuracy by over 10%. This improvement resulted from the modification in network structure and training schedule. Currently, we work on visualization analysis on OCT images (see the following figure). We believe that the successful interpretation will enhance the reliability of CNN model and bring us to a deeper insight into biomedical images.
