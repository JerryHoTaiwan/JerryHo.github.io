I have worked on this project since July 2019. The standard medical practice for cancer diagnosis requires histopathology, which is a time-consuming procedure. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an alternative that is relatively fast and non-invasive and able to capture three-dimensional structures of epithelial tissue. Unlike most previous OCT systems, which cannot capture crucial cellular-level information for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) diagnosis, the full-field OCT (FF-OCT) technology used in this paper is able to produce images at sub-micron resolution and thereby facilitates the development of a deep learning algorithm for SCC detection. Experimental results show that the SCC detection algorithm can achieve an accuracy of 80% for mouse skin. Using the sub-micron FF-OCT imaging system, the proposed SCC detection algorithm has the potential for in-vivo applications. The publication of this project is under prepareation
