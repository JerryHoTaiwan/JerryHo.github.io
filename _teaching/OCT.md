I have worked on this project since July 2019. The squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a type of skin cancer that is hard to diagnose. The traditional diagnosis of SCC has to rely on a biopsy of skin tissue, which is time-consuming. An alternative approach is using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to capture the three-dimensional structure of skin tissue, which is a relatively quick, non-invasive technique. Unlike most previous OCT works that fail to capture crucial cellular-level information for SCC diagnosis, we leverage a novel OCT technology to capture images at sub-micron resolution and develop a deep learning algorithm for SCC detection. Experimental results show that the algorithm can achieve an 80% accuracy for mice SCC detection. We also gained an insight into pathological patterns through model interpretation (see the following figure). The results demonstrate the potential of sub-micron OCT imaging for on-site SCC detection. The publication of this project is under prepareation
