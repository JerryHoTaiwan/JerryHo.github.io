Welcome! <br> My name is Chi-Jui (Jerry) Ho, a Ph.D. student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of UC San Diego. <br/>
I am a Ph.D. student in [Computational Imaging System Lab](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsd-computational-imaging/) and advised by Prof. [Nick Antipa](http://nickantipa.com). My research interests include end-to-end optimization, wave optics, and computational photography. I was in Video Processing Lab in lab rotation, where I worked on medical image registration under Prof. [Truong Nguyen's](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/people/profile/truong-q-nguyen) advice.<br/>
Before joining UC San Diego, I received my B.S. degree at electrical engineering of National Taiwan University (NTU) in 2019, where I also worked on computational photography. 

Work Experience: <br/>
[June - Sep. 2024] Research Scientist Intern at Meta Reality Labs Research, Redmond, WA <br/>
[July - Aug. 2018] Summer Intern at MediaTek, Hsinchu, Taiwan
