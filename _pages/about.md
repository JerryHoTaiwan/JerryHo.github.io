Welcome! <br> My name is Chi-Jui (Jerry) Ho, a first year Ph.D. student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of UC San Diego. <br/>
I am now working with Prof. Truong Q. Nguyen and Prof. Nick Antipa. <br/>
I received my B.S. degree at electrical engineering of National Taiwan University (NTU) in 2019. My research interests include computational imaging and image correspondence estimation.<br/>
When I am not working, I love playing and watching baseball. My another big hobby is Go, where I am a three-dan amateur player in Taiwan. <br/>
