Welcome! <br> My name is Chi-Jui (Jerry) Ho, a second year Ph.D. student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of UC San Diego. <br/>
I am now working with Prof. [Nick Antipa](http://nickantipa.com) and Prof. [Truong Q. Nguyen](http://videoprocessing.ucsd.edu). <br/> My research interests include computational imaging and medical image registration.<br/>
Before joining UC San Diego, I received my B.S. degree at electrical engineering of National Taiwan University (NTU) in 2019. 
When I am not working, I love playing and watching baseball. My another big hobby is Go, where I am a three-dan amateur player in Taiwan. <br/>
