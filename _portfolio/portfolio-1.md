I attended NTU Undergraduate Innovation Award on 7th September. In this competition, every team gave a 5 minutes presentation and then presented before the poster. My work "Autofocus by Artificail Intellegence" won the first prize among 20 selected teams. It is very pleased for me to graduate from NTU with this honor. Thanks for all attended professors and the organization. <br/>
