I and two classmates attended AIRush 2019, an Asia-wide AI competition held by LINE and Naver. 100 teams attend the elimination round, whose topic is Image Classification (on LINE stickers). We ranked 6th in this round and was admitted to enter the final round on behalf of Taiwan. The final round is held in Chuncheon, Korea, and the topic is Click Through Rate Prediction. We finally ranked 6th in this round. It was a little bit regretful that we failed to rank in top-3 for our country, but it was really a valuable experience to interact with AI researchers from other country. Thanks for the organization and the manager of Team Taiwan. I really encourage other classmates or juniors to attend this competition next year. <br/>
