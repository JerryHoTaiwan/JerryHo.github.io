I attended Computex 2019, the second largest computer expo in the world, on behalf of our lab to show our demo video of autofocus. This was my first time to interact with that many engineers from industry. Some of them were excited about our results. I also obtained some advice about how to implement our algorithm to mobile device. It is really a cool experience.
